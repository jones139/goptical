Goptical is a C++ optical design and simulation library. Goptical is
free software and is part of the @url http://www.gnu.org/ {GNU project}.

It provides model classes for optical components, surfaces and
materials. It enables building optical systems by creating and
placing various optical components in a 3d space and simulates light
propagation through the system. Classical optical design analysis
tools can be used on optical systems.

It takes advantages of the C++ object model to allow building complex
optical systems with a few classes instanciations as optical
components are represented by language objects.
