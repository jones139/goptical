             GNU Optical design and simulation library
             =========================================

Goptical is a C++ optical design and simulation library. Goptical is
free software and is part of the GNU project.

It provides model classes for optical components, surfaces and
materials. It enables building optical systems by creating and
placing various optical components in a 3d space and simulates light
propagation through the system. Classical optical design analysis
tools can be used on optical systems.

It takes advantages of the C++ object model to allow building complex
optical systems with a few classes instanciations as optical
components are represented by language objects.
